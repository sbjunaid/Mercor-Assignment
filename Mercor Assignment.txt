Summary---
1)Preprocessing: Handle categorical features and split data.
2)BERT Embeddings: Convert text data into numerical embeddings.
3)Feature Combination: Combine embeddings with other features.
4)Model Training: Train an XGBoost classifier on the combined features.
5)Evaluation: Assess model performance and accuracy.
6)Prediction: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.

No null value is found.
Accuracy is near to 90%.
Code is in jupyter notebook.
First analysis is done which was hidden and the code for model and testing new data is shared.
This all can be done on this short period of time, and hoping the result is satisfying :).
